Participant recruitment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Current efforts & past results
==============================

The Recruitment :ref:`Working Group <working_groups>` is actively exploring and testing out recruitment approaches!

See `this Google doc <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l0NcZLKQYdHJgZ71Tk849jZWTII47MKg4Swa5QeemwA/edit?usp=sharing>`__ for recent observations about approaches and success.

Here are some general observations:

-  Substantial carryover effects to other studies (in different age range) when one group advertises a study! We’re getting benefits of cooperation, and really not seeing “competition” between CHS studies at this point.

-  Paying participants makes a huge difference in ability to recruit, as well as diversity of participants. Separately, we believe it’s ethical to pay families for their time & contribution. We currently aim for ~$15/hour for the expected duration of the study. Currently done by researchers manually sending gift cards post-study; eventual plans to provide centralized compensation functionality.

Existing avenues for online outreach:
=====================================

-  Facebook page

   -  Posting to AcademicMamas w/ babies born 2017 page (and tagging specific moms with kids in age range) has had the most success (but still very small-scale - a total of maybe 10 kids)
   -  Occasional attempts at ‘boosting’ posts advertising studies (most recently, ~6000 views from new parents) has never yielded participants for unpaid studies
   -  Interested labs may advertise via the CHS page - we send an invite to be an editor, you may need to double check at https://www.facebook.com/pages/?category=invites to find it. There are known problems about the invites being hard to find: https://www.facebook.com/business/help/community/question/?id=1249301125083191
   -  Experimenting with interest targeting and recording results would be a helpful contribution!

Potential approaches:
=====================

-  Ask participants to tell their friends

   -  Include in study debriefing
   -  Provide video for download/sharing
   -  Email after study
   -  Provide printable flyers on website

-  Option to become a parent ambassador/advisor, or just be more available to parents

   -  Advance testing of new studies
   -  Providing more detailed feedback on studies & parent-facing text
   -  Occasional joint meetings, or involvement in other CHS meetings
   -  Share with parent groups online
   -  “Office hours” - easy to join group video chat
   -  Schedule participants (even though it’s unnecessary) to provide
      “accountability” when people intend to participate

-  Cultivate a more active social media presence

   -  Regularly posted content - e.g.

      -  Info about cognitive development or recent studies, interesting articles
      -  Cute videos of participants
      -  Status updates
      -  Intros to lab members
      -  Q&A about cognitive development
      -  Encourage sharing cute pictures/videos on particular topics
      -  “Ask your kid” feature - get funny answers to questions

   -  Read about how to do this and/or get help from people who know what they’re doing

-  In-person local advertising (see Rianna’s `Cambridge/Boston map <https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1eeO41SXUID-NqTRba_xuFybEKowkuMIY>`__).
   Put up flyers and/or talk to local institutions/people that work with
   kids to get them excited about CHS, ask them to mention it to
   families, maintain relationships. Examples of places we've looked when advertising 
   locally in Cambridge:

   -  Look at lists like `Boston Coop <http://bostoncoop.net/~nrbutler/BabyGuide.html>`__, `Mommy Poppins drop-in indoor playspaces <https://mommypoppins.com/kids/drop-in-indoor-play-spaces-for-boston-babies-toddlers-and-preschoolers>`__, `City Moms Blog <https://boston.citymomsblog.com/guide/8-rainy-day-infant-toddler-friendly-activities-in-boston/>`__ to gather more ideas
   -  Activities: Cambridge Public Library lapsit, other activities like `Music Together <https://www.musictogether.com/>`__
   -  Parent groups: look for new parent support groups, new parent education, baby playgroups.
   -  Toy stores; Baby stuff secondhand shops, e.g. `Two Little Monkeys <http://www.twolittlemonkeysconsignment.com/>`__
   -  Pediatricians’ offices
   -  Parks
   -  Daycares, preschools, elementary schools, afterschool programs
   -  MIT museum (not because they get a ton of kids but because we already have a connection via MIT, and in the future maybe they’d like to host an interactive CHS display...)
   -  `Cambridge Family Resource Center <http://www.cpsd.us/cms/one.aspx?pageId=3474753>`__
   -  `Baby U, Center for Families playgroups, other parent ed <https://www.cambridgema.gov/DHSP/programsforfamilies>`__

-  Go to events with kids and talk with families directly

   -  Cambridge Science Festival
   -  Keep an eye out on various calendars for events (e.g., `Cambridge DHSP <https://www.cambridgema.gov/~/media/Files/DHSP/centerforfamilies/Events.pdf?la=en>`_)
   -  Boston Children’s Museum

-  Possible features to support recruitment

   -  Point system
   -  Let parents comment on studies publicly?

-  Media/online outreach

   -  Talk to groups that do online research with adults (e.g. LabInTheWild, TestMyBrain) to see if they’d be up for linking to CHS
   -  Talk to groups that do online research with kids -  e.g. https://www.babysleepstudy.org/studysignup,
   -  Ask institutions that might be interested about featuring/linking to CHS, or publishing content we provide - examples:

      -  Boston Children’s Museum
      -  https://www.parentingscience.com/online-parenting-studies.html
      -  http://www.scholastic.com/parents/blogs
      -  https://www.sciencedaily.com/news/mind_brain/child_psychology/
      -  https://theconversation.com/us (write an article?)
      -  http://www.parenting.com/
      -  https://www.babycenter.com/
      -  https://mommypoppins.com/kids/drop-in-indoor-play-spaces-for-boston-babies-toddlers-and-preschoolers
         (can request listing)
      -  https://boston.citymomsblog.com/guide/8-rainy-day-infant-toddler-friendly-activities-in-boston/
         (guest post submission)

   -  Work w/ parenting-focused bloggers (esp. who don’t focus exclusively on paid review type posts)
   -  Ask for help from MIT media folks
   -  Posting in parent groups - BabyCenter, Facebook birth clubs, etc.

-  Better organize efforts across labs
-  Piggyback on local efforts to send out mailings
-  Actual advertising - e.g. Facebook, Google AdWords, magazine or public transit ad space
