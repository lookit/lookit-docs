Community involvement
================================================

Currently the Children Helping Science (CHS) project is run by three people working at home during a
pandemic. We had a description here of all the things we do, but really,
enough said.

Ways *all* CHS researchers contribute
----------------------------------------

1. Peer-to-peer support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We ask that everyone who goes through the tutorial helps to answer
questions from other researchers, and works on improving any sections
that were confusing!

2. Provide peer feedback on studies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before submitting a study to CHS, researchers gather peer feedback
(see :ref:`Study approval process <study_approval>`).
This is a quick and lightweight process, not scientific peer review, but
it does a lot to improve the participant experience! As a researcher on
CHS, you will help to review other studies as well as posting your
own for feedback.

3. Recruitment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you start running your study, you will need to actively recruit
participants. There’s a shared CHS participant pool, but we need
everyone’s combined efforts to build it.

If you have programming experience (or employ someone who does)
---------------------------------------------------------------

CHS is an open-source project, but struggles with the problem that relatively few of 
its primary stakeholders (developmental researchers) feel equipped to contribute to 
feature development. If you have experience programming in Python, the most helpful way 
to contribute is to :ref:`Set up for local development <Local dev setup>` on the CHS codebase, take 
ownership of an issue in the lookit-api repo and make a PR with your implementation 
(and your unit tests ;) ).

.. _working_groups:

Working Groups
==================

In addition to the actions described above, individual researchers are
organized into a variety of Working Groups that focus on specific
challenges to build resources for the community.

The existence of the Working Groups has many advantages, including:

- Formally recognizing the work that many people volunteer to do in the
  background, that might otherwise be invisible 
- Making sure we have a wide range of voices involved in generating ideas and making decisions
  about our shared platform, beyond just the small number of people on the 
  Core Team 
- Providing a way for people to opt into the discussions they
  most want to be a part of so that (e.g.,) if you want to be involved
  with decisions about recruitment strategies you can be part of a group
  that does so, rather than decisions being made at unpredictable times
  and only by those who (e.g.,) happen to be paying attention to a general
  email listserv at that time.

Anyone involved with a current study on CHS, or who is developing
one, is very welcome to join a Working Group! We also have an
expectation that **any research team hosting a study on CHS will have
at least one member who is a member of at least one Working Group**,
with a flexible time commitment of about 2 hours/week. The person
meeting this requirement for their research group should be a “main”
member of the group, which will typically mean a lab manager, graduate
student, or PI (not, e.g., an undergrad doing a small number of hours of
lab work each week).

Here are the current working groups:

Best Practices for Video Chat Studies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this Working Group is to develop best practices (and, rarely, rules) about running video chat studies (also called "synchronous" studies, these are typically "Zoom" studies). Over the past couple of years, there have been many groups independently identifying great ways to do video chat studies, and we hope to discuss and iterate on what a diverse group of researchers have done. As we develop resources for best practices, members of CHS (and others) may choose to follow them because they are ideas that have been refined over time by a large and diverse group of people, and also just because consistency can be inherently valuable (e.g., even if a practice is not inherently better than some alternative, being consistent with our participants can make things easier and more predictable for them). See a draft of some ideas `here <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t5MY6tfA_o9MVGSBa0j_2hXfDRpRq5mSLnoayUjBLUA/edit?usp=sharing>`_.

Recruitment (social media, etc.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this Working Group is to increase the size and diversity of
the participant pool. Examples of work might include producing posts for
social media, contacting parenting blogs, and coordinating efforts from
individual labs. In addition to balancing the goals of size and
diversity, another pair of goals to balance will be exploitation
vs. exploration (i.e., small tweaks to known recruitment methods
vs. moonshots for much better solutions).

Eliciting and organizing feature feedback from researchers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this Working Group is to gather information from researchers
in multiple ways (e.g., surveys, focus groups, monitoring of questions
on Slack and GitHub issues) about potential new features for CHS, and
work towards prioritizing them. This requires synthesizing information
about what would best benefit researchers and what is easiest for the
programmers to implement, and so this group will work with the
programmers as well.

Advise and support new CHS researchers (“Researcher onboarding”)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this Working Group is to help new researchers who are
designing their first CHS study. This can involve creating additional
tutorials/samples/documentation, providing 1-on-1 mentoring, and
monitoring a Slack channel where new researchers ask questions.

Parent-facing “first 10 minutes”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this Working Group is to maximize the parent-facing
experience, from finding CHS to finishing the consent for the child’s
first study. Example work might include revising the homepage and doing
focus group (user experience) studies of naive parents navigating it,
creating informational videos about what participation entails and
instructions for participating (perhaps with help from the “assets”
working group), and streamlining the informed consent process. An MIT
usability & accessibility group may be available for support.

Producing creative assets (e.g., recruitment videos)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this Working Group is to produce a library of available
pictures, videos, and audio. A primary use for these would be the
“Recruitment” group, though it is also possible that creative assets
might be used for other purposes (e.g., a library of stimuli available
for studies, such as infant attention-getters and royalty-free cartoon
pictures of many characters).

Researcher-facing “first 10 minutes”
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of this Working Group is to maximize the researcher-facing
experience, from discovering CHS to deciding whether or not it might
be a good fit for their research. For example, this group might create a
webpage that is directed towards PIs, to determine in 3-5 minutes
whether joining CHS might be a good use of a graduate student’s time.
Another webpage might be directed towards graduate students, to get a
sense of the types of research CHS is a good fit for, and what types
of skills would be necessary to conduct that research via CHS. Much
of this information already exists, but optimizing it for different
audiences could make a big difference in the uptake of CHS by
research teams.

The A-Team
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Named after a TV show about mercenaries for hire: “If you have a
problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you
can hire… the A-Team.” For CHS, this Working Group will work on all
of the miscellaneous tasks that are shorter term (so they don’t have
their own working group) but totally essential for the development of
CHS. Maybe a couple of weeks working on legal and ethical issues to
build a knowledge base for getting CHS access agreement signed. And
then the next project might be exploring non-monetary compensation for
families (certificates? personalized information?). All skill sets
welcome for a well-balanced group of problem solvers.
