2. Contributing to the codebase
##################################

Lookit is an open-source project, meaning that the code is freely available and anyone can contribute. This includes the actual Lookit platform, the components used in studies, AND the documentation you're reading now. Community contributions and input are critical to the project!

In this section, you'll make your first "Pull request" (PR) to propose a change to the documentation [#]_. Your change will just be to add yourself to a list of tutorial participants. This way, you'll be comfortable making substantive changes whenever you're ready!

Later on in the tutorial, if you come across something confusing or you have an idea to improve the instructions or exercises, you can follow these same instructions to fix it. Although we recognize that most Lookit users will not be ready to contribute to the code that makes Lookit run, editing the documentation is something everyone can do! We need your help to keep it up-to-date and constantly improving!

.. _First PR: 

Making your first pull request (PR)
------------------------------------
All of the code that makes Lookit run is stored on GitHub, which makes it easy to keep track of changes over time and merge changes from many collaborators. There are several code repositories or "repos" that house different pieces of the project. Here we are going to walk through making a change to the documentation repo, `lookit-docs <https://github.com/lookit/lookit-docs>`_. Making a "pull request" or PR is a way to ask that your edits be incorporated into the main codebase. It's actually not too hard, and it's a great way to contribute! 

Don't worry about making a mistake and somehow messing up the documentation - you can't directly edit the "official" version of the files! There is always a review process before your changes are merged in. 

1. In a separate tab, go to https://github.com/lookit/lookit-docs and click "Fork" in the top right corner. You'll need to make an account on GitHub if you don't have one already. You only need to do this once - for future changes you can skip this step.

      :alt: Fork button on GitHub
    
2. From the page you are reading right now (or in the future, from whatever docs page you want to edit -- *not* from GitHub!), scroll up and click the "Edit on GitHub" button at the top right. For this first PR, you'll be editing the page you're reading right now (https://lookit.readthedocs.io/en/develop/tutorial-contributing.html)!

   .. image:: _static/img/tutorial/edit_on_github_button.png
      :alt: Edit on GitHub button at the top of this page

3. Clicking "Edit on GitHub" will bring you to a page like the one shown below. Click the pencil icon on this page to start editing the file. 

   .. image:: _static/img/tutorial/github_edit_button.png
      :alt: Edit button on GitHub

   You may see a message that submitting a change will write it to a new branch in your fork. That's ok!
 
   .. image:: _static/img/tutorial/new_branch_message.png
      :alt: New branch message on GitHub
    
4. Make your changes! For this PR, just add your name and institution to the list of tutorial participants. Click the "Preview changes" tab to make sure everything looks the way you want it to. You can go back and forth between the "Edit file" and "Preview changes" tabs as you make more involved changes.

   .. image:: _static/img/tutorial/preview_tab.png
      :alt: Preview changes and edit file tabs on GitHub

5. Scroll down to "Propose file change." Enter a short description of your change, and then click the green "Propose file change" button:

   .. image:: _static/img/tutorial/propose_file_change.png
      :alt: Propose file change section on GitHub
    
6. Click the green "Create pull request" button on the page that appears next:

   .. image:: _static/img/tutorial/create_pr.png
      :alt: Create pull request on GitHub

7. Hooray! You've created your first PR. You should now be at a page where it's been given a number:

   .. image:: _static/img/tutorial/pr_view.png
      :alt: PR view on GitHub

The PR will now be in a list for Lookit staff to review. You can return to this page to check on it; if you have allowed Github to send notifications via email (the default), you will also get an email about any activity. You can also see your PR in the list by going to https://github.com/lookit/lookit-docs and clicking on "Pull requests": 

.. image:: _static/img/tutorial/pr_tab.png
    :alt: See all PRs on GitHub

This process is the easiest way to make a change to a particular file in the documentation. If you want to edit multiple files, add new files, and/or reorganize things, you will probably want to try out your changes locally before submitting your PR. You can learn more in the :ref:`section on Contributor Guidelines<Contributor Guidelines>`. You don't need to know how to do that for the purposes of this tutorial, though - just know it's *possible* to deal with multiple files at once.

Checking for and creating issues on Github
-------------------------------------------

What if you notice a problem while using Lookit, or something unclear in the documentation, but it's not something you know how to fix? Or what if you find yourself wishing there were a particular feature that would make your research easier? 

.. image:: _static/img/tutorial/issues_tab.png
    :alt: See all issues on GitHub

To track bug reports and feature requests, we use GitHub **issues**. You can see issues by clicking on the "Issues" tab in the appropriate repository or "repo":

- `lookit-api <https://github.com/lookit/lookit-api>`_ is the repo for the Lookit site: issues with anything to do with participant login or data, how current and past studies are displayed to participants, how you view data and manage your studies

- `ember-lookit-frameplayer <https://github.com/lookit/ember-lookit-frameplayer>`_ is the repo for the experiment components themselves: issues with how particular frames behave, frames you'd find useful, counterbalancing/condition assignment, etc.

- `lookit-docs <https://github.com/lookit/lookit-docs>`_ is the repo for the documentation: anything about the docs you're reading now!

To request a feature or report a bug, first search the existing issues to see if your idea is already there.

.. image:: _static/img/tutorial/search_issues.png
    :alt: Search issues on GitHub

If so, comment on it or add a thumbs-up reaction so Lookit staff know there's more interest! If not, click the green "New issue" button at the top right.

.. image:: _static/img/tutorial/new_issue.png
    :alt: Create new issue on GitHub
    
You will need to select an issue type. Choose the type that's closest to what you want to describe - probably "bug report" or "feature request":
    
.. image:: _static/img/tutorial/issue_types.png
    :alt: Select issue type on GitHub

If you had to select an issue type, you'll now have a template to fill in with information. If you're not using a template, try to give a clear one-sentence summary of the problem or requested feature/change, followed by any details needed to reproduce the problem or understand the proposed change. Then click the green "Submit new issue" button to create your issue. 

.. image:: _static/img/tutorial/issue_template.png
    :alt: Fill out issue template on GitHub
    
Your issue will now have a number assigned to it and will be listed in the issue list you looked at earlier:

.. image:: _static/img/tutorial/issue.png
    :alt: Issue on GitHub
    
Lookit staff may respond to ask for further information, schedule it for future development, and/or wait for community feedback about the idea to gauge demand.

Exercises
----------

1. Suppose you would like to be able to download a file with scrambled or random data of the same form as your actual data, so that you could get your analysis scripts working without contaminating your real dataset. Which GitHub repo should you create an issue in?

   .. raw:: html

    <details style="margin-left:50px;">
        <summary>Click for answer</summary>
        <p>lookit-api; this is functionality to do with the researcher interface.</p>
    </details>

2. Suppose you would like to be able to provide a study in the appropriate language for a given participant. Is there a Github issue in the lookit-api repo that addresses this?

   .. raw:: html

    <details style="margin-left:50px;">
        <summary>Click for answer</summary>
        <p>Yes, <a href="https://github.com/lookit/lookit-api/issues/181" target="_blank">#181</a>. You can find it by going to https://github.com/lookit/lookit-api/issues/ and searching for "language."</p>
    </details>


.. [#] This section, and the excellent idea to make "your first PR" an early and required step, is based on the `OpenAPS documentation <https://openaps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/While%20You%20Wait%20For%20Gear/loops-in-progress.html>`_. Go help with their docs too. What? You didn't realize this tutorial was secretly just a way to get developmental psychologists working on open-source artificial pancreas systems?
