Welcome to Lookit's documentation!
==========================================

The `Lookit codebase <https://github.com/lookit/>`_ contains two main repositories:

* `lookit-api <https://github.com/lookit/lookit-api>`_, a Django application that houses what were previously separate Experimenter and Lookit applications. Experimenter is a platform for designing and administering research studies, meant for researchers. The Lookit platform is participant-facing, where users can signup and take part in studies.

* `ember-lookit-frameplayer <https://github.com/lookit/ember-lookit-frameplayer>`_, an Ember app that runs studies in the web browser

The documentation you are reading now lives in `lookit-docs <https://github.com/lookit/lookit-docs>`_.

It has been jointly developed by MIT and the `Center for Open Science <https://cos.io/>`_.
