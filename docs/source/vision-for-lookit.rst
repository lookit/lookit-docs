Project overview
==========================

Lookit is a platform for doing developmental research run by a small academic group at MIT.
Our vision is of **a collaborative online lab**:

-  Large collaborative “online lab” run by group at MIT
-  Single participant interface; shared participant pool, servers;
   central & shared recruitment in addition to individual labs’ efforts
-  Lookit team provides training, IRB coordination, study
   implementation, design support, ongoing development, documentation
-  Researchers independent, but with centralized approval of studies
   (covering technical problems, basic compliance with ethical
   guidelines, and clarity for parents)
-  Support/incentives for best practices (e.g. preregistration,
   publishing materials and data, clearly demarcating pilot data)
-  Can be funded (at steady state) primarily by participating labs’
   usage, although open to alternate models

Mission statement
-------------------------

Lower barriers to conducting and participating in rigorous,
reproducible developmental research that advances the understanding
of development and its implications for education, parenting, policy,
and medicine. 
   
We are committed to

-  Open source development
-  Encouraging data and protocol sharing
-  Encouraging best practices in experimental design
-  Advancing our understanding of methods
-  Recruiting a representative participant pool
-  Respecting participants’ time and parents as partners in discovery
-  Enabling non-traditional developmental researchers and supporting
   work that benefits children or families
