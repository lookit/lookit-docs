These papers introduced a prototype of Lookit and reported on the initial test studies we ran. They may have helpful information about general considerations for unmoderated online research - e.g., do we basically see similar looking times even though the environment is noisier (spoilers: yes) and can you see where kids are looking from webcam (also yes)? 

However, the platform itself has been renamed to "Children Helping Science" and completely re-engineered since these studies were conducted starting in 2014, so some of the details are no longer relevant - in particular, video quality is much better and we're no longer collecting variable-framerate .flv files.

Here's some of the research that's come out of the CHS (formerly "Lookit") platform! There's a lot more in prep, soif you're interested in questions like whether someone's tried X task on CHS and how it went, we recommend asking in the #researchers channel on Slack for more up-to-date info.
