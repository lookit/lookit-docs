Getting started
=========================================================================================

If you're a researcher interested in using Lookit to run your own developmental studies, here's how you get started!

For a 20-minute overview of how Lookit works, you can also read Jenna Croteau's excellent `Introduction to Lookit  <https://github.com/lookit/research-resources/raw/master/Training/IntroductionToLookit.pdf>`__ document.

.. admonition:: Do I have to do these in order?

   No! These steps can all be completed in parallel. Except for joining the Slack workspace, please do that first in case you have questions.

A. Join the Slack workspace!
----------------------------

Please `fill out this form <https://forms.gle/WVapAncBwRPR7pLX9>`__ for
an invite.

Slack is our primary means of communication about new features, best
practices, etc. It’s also where you should go with any questions or
technical support requests. There are a lot of participating researchers
(over 400 at last count!) who may be able to help!

B. Legal/logistical steps
-------------------------

You can go ahead and create an account on Lookit to start preparing your
studies right away, but to actually collect data from families on Lookit, your lab will
need to review the Terms of Use and sign a one-time institutional
agreement with MIT. Any studies you run will need to be approved by your
own IRB, just like studies you run in person. For more detail, see :ref:`IRB and legal information <legal>`. Note that you only need **one agreement** per PI (not separate
agreements for each student).

1. Review the Terms of Use and complete a short quiz.

2. Get an institutional agreement signed by an authorized signer for
   your institution.

3. Edit your IRB protocol to include online testing, or submit a new
   protocol for your proposed online study.
   

C. Familiarize yourself with the Lookit Working Groups
------------------------------------------------------

Although a Core Team at MIT provides a foundation for Lookit to
function, a lot of great additional work is done by the community of
researchers working together on Lookit to run studies. For example, one
Working Group is focused on increasing our sample size and diversity,
and another is focused on supporting new researchers as they learn how
to use Lookit.

Please review the :ref:`descriptions of the current working groups <working_groups>`. 
At least one person from your lab (the more the merrier!) should fill out the `survey <https://yaleas.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cAp5I97tgIY8zEF>`__ to express preferences for working on particular topics; we'll then be in touch to help you join a group! 

D. Create a lab on Lookit
-------------------------

You can go to https://lookit.mit.edu/exp/labs to create
your own “lab” on Lookit. After creating your lab, you can go ahead and put studies in it and use it to manage access to your group’s studies. However, you won’t be able
to submit these studies to run on Lookit until the lab is approved to
test. This happens once

(a) you have a signed institutional agreement for the lab PI, and
(b) someone in the group has taken the terms of use quiz   

E. Study setup steps
--------------------

1. Complete the :ref:`Lookit tutorial <tutorial>` to get familiar with how the platform 
   works and how to implement a study on it.

2. Figure out the details of how your study will work - counterbalancing, 
   practice trials, etc. Draft the parent-facing instructions, record any audio and video
   needed (e.g., verbal instructions, voiceover/questions, demos), and
   collect your stimuli. See :ref:`advice here <stim_prep>`.

4. Set up your study on Lookit and get it working just how you want it
   to! You’ll need to `set each of these
   fields <https://lookit.readthedocs.io/en/develop/researchers-set-study-fields.html>`__
   and write and test your study protocol.

5. Gather :ref:`peer feedback <peer review>` on your study to improve it; edit and 
   iterate.

6. Submit your study for :ref:`internal review <study_approval>`.
   This process, like peer review at a journal, can take a bit of time
   to complete, and you might need to go through more than one
   revise-and-resubmit to get approval to run your study. To minimize
   the chances of repeated revise-and-resubmits, researchers are
   strongly encouraged to spend time polishing their studies as much as
   possible before submitting, including asking others to go through the
   study and provide feedback.

7. Once your study has successfully passed internal review, start data
   collection!

8. Put a link to Lookit on a parent-facing part of your lab or personal
   researcher website. This might include something like this: “Did you
   know that you can participate in our research from the comfort of
   your own home? `Click here to check out Lookit, an online platform
   for developmental research. <https://lookit.mit.edu>`__ Families can
   participate in our studies on their home computers, any time they
   want!”
