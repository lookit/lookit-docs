Here are some slides and videos you may want to check out while getting started or when training other lab members!

.. admonition:: "Children Helping Science" vs "Lookit"

   Note that most of these materials were created prior to the merger between Children Helping Science and Lookit, and therefore use the "Lookit" term to refer to the entire site infrastructure. We now refer to the "Lookit" website/platform as "Children Helping Science" (CHS), and we still use the "Lookit" term for the internal experiment runner.

- Most communication among CHS researchers happens via a Slack workspace. Fill out `this form  <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScI2h7G6aUSJb-I3fGHw2nB8HcuaomuNLiwta2CXhGGF2ZL-Q/viewform>`_ to receive an invite. This is the best place to ask general questions or get tech support! 

- The documentation for individual experiment 'frames' lives :ref:`here <elf:index>` in the "Lookit experiment runner" tab.

- Running into a problem and want to check if it's a known issue, or have an idea for a handy new feature? Check out and/or add to the issues listed for the `CHS platform <https://github.com/lookit/lookit-api/issues>`_, for the `Lookit experiment components/player <https://github.com/lookit/ember-lookit-frameplayer/issues>`_, and for the `lookit-jspsych experiment runner <https://github.com/lookit/lookit-jspsych/issues>`_.
