------------------------------------
Staying up-to-date and getting help
------------------------------------

- Most communication among CHS researchers happens via the **MIT Lookit Slack** workspace. Fill out `this form  <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScI2h7G6aUSJb-I3fGHw2nB8HcuaomuNLiwta2CXhGGF2ZL-Q/viewform>`_ to receive an invite. This is the best place to get the most up-do-date information about the site, ask general questions, and get tech support! 

- If you're looking for information about building experiments on our platform, see the separate documentation pages for the :ref:`Lookit Ember Frameplayer <elf:index>` ("Lookit EFP" tab at the top of the navigation menu), and CHS's custom `jsPsych experiment builder <https://lookit.readthedocs.io/projects/chs-jspsych/en/latest/>`__ ("jsPsych" tab).

- Check out our :ref:`FAQ page <faq>`, or search the site using the search bar above the navigation menu.

- Join the `Lookit-research email list <http://mailman.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/lookit-research>`__ for occasional (2-4x/year) progress updates.

CHS Learning Materials and Other Resources
--------------------------------------------

Below is a list of more information and resources about CHS. Some of these links provide a high-level overview of the platform that might be useful, for instance, while getting started, training other lab members, or introducing CHS to colleagues or families. There are also other materials that researchers might find useful for recruitment or learning how to use the site.

.. admonition:: "Children Helping Science" vs "Lookit"

   Note that most of these materials were created prior to the merger between Children Helping Science and Lookit, and therefore use the "Lookit" term to refer to the entire site infrastructure. We now refer to the "Lookit" website/platform as "Children Helping Science" (CHS), and we still use the "Lookit" term for the internal experiment runner.
   Also, some of the screenshots etc. used in the learning materials here might be out of date. Please refer to tutorial and other pages on this website for the most up-to-date information.
