3. Create a study
====================

At this point in the tutorial, you should decide whether you want your first CHS study to use the Lookit or jsPsych experiment runner. Then, just complete the tutorial for that section, and move on to :ref:`Step 4: Managing Study Data <tutorial-manage-data>`.

Or, if your study involves a link to an experiment or scheduling platform hosted somewhere else, you can skip to step 4 in the tutorial: :ref:`Managing Study Data <tutorial-manage-data>`.
