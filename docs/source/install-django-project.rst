Installation: lookit-api (Django project)
=========================================

``lookit-api`` is the codebase for Experimenter and Lookit, excluding the actual
studies themselves. Any functionality you see as a researcher or a
participant (e.g., signing up, adding a child, editing or deploying a
study, downloading data) is part of the ``lookit-api`` repo. 
This project is built using Django and PostgreSQL. (The studies
themselves use Ember.js; see Ember portion of codebase,
`ember-lookit-frameplayer <https://github.com/lookit/ember-lookit-frameplayer>`__.),
It was initially developed by the `Center for Open Science <https://cos.io/>`__.

If you install only the ``lookit-api`` project locally, you will be able
to edit any functionality that does not require actual study
participation. For instance, you could contribute an improvement to how
studies are displayed to participants or create a new CSV format for
downloading data as a researcher.

   Note: These instructions are for Mac OS. Installing on another OS?
   Please consider documenting the exact steps you take and submitting a
   PR to the lookit-api repo to update the documentation!

Basic installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note: the ``$`` represents the command prompt below - e.g. the start of a new line in Terminal. Don't actually type it in!

- Clone the lookit-api repo: ``$ git clone https://github.com/lookit/lookit-api.git``
- Navigate to the root project directory: ``$ cd lookit-api``
- Use ``$ pipenv --version`` to see if you already have pipenv installed. If it is, you 
  will see the version; if not, you will see "pipenv: command not found". If needed, 
  install using ``pip install pipenv``.
- Create a virtual environment using pipenv and Python 3.8: ``$ pipenv --python 3.8``
  If you don't have Python 3.8 available, you can download it from 
  https://www.python.org/downloads/.
- Enter the virtual environment using ``$ pipenv shell``.
- Install invoke using ``$ pip install invoke``.
- Use the invoke script to go through setup: ``$ invoke setup`` This will install dependencies,
  create a local .env file, create local SSL certificates, and set up a postgresql database.
  You will be prompted a few times to enter your password, which is because a command is 
  being run using ``sudo`` - this should be the password you use
  to log in to your account on your computer. When it finishes, you should see something like:
  
  ::

     Serving at https://127.0.0.1:8000
     Watching for file changes with StatReloader
     
- Create a superuser by running ``python manage.py createsuperuser``
    
Now you can go to https://localhost:8000 to see your local Lookit server! You should be able to log in using 
the superuser credentials you created during setup.
  
Going forward, you can run the server by navigating to the lookit-api directory, 
entering the virtualenv (``$ pipenv shell``), and typing ``$ invoke server``.

If you are not working extensively with lookit-api - i.e., if you just want to make some 
new frames - you do not need to run celery, rabbitmq, or docker.

Running Celery and Rabbitmq
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These tools handle deferred tasks like sending emails and generating large file downloads.

- Run ``$ rabbitmq-server`` to start up the rabbitmq server.
- Run ``$ invoke celery-service`` to start celery, which will talk to rabbitmq. 

Running Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use docker to build experiment runner images. If you are testing experiment builds, you will 
need to have Docker running - you can simply run ``$open /Applications/Docker.app`` or open it 
from Applications. 

Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create participant and researcher accounts through the regular signup flow on 
your local instance. To access Experimenter you will need to add two-factor authentication
to your account following the prompts. In order to access the admin interface 
(https://localhost:8000/__CTRL__),
which provides a convenient way to access and edit records, you will need to log in using
the superuser you created earlier using manage.py. 

Handling video
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project includes an incoming webhook handler for an event generated
by the Pipe video recording service when video is transferred to our S3
storage. This requires a webhook key for authentication. It can be
generated via our Pipe account and, for local testing, stored in
project/settings/local.py as ``PIPE_WEBHOOK_KEY``. 

Pipe needs to be told where to send the webhook: 
You can use Ngrok to generate a public URL that 
/exp/renamevideo 
#TODO here

However, Pipe will
continue to use the handler on the production/staging site unless you
edit the settings to send it somewhere else (e.g., using ngrok to send
to localhost for testing).

Common Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During installation, you may see the following:

::

   psql: FATAL:  role "postgres" does not exist

To fix, run something like the following from your home directory:

::

   $../../../usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.6.3/bin/createuser -s postgres

If your version of postgres is different than 9.6.3, replace with the
correct version above. Running this command should be a one-time thing.

You might also have issues with the installation of ``pygraphviz``, with
errors like

::

   running install
   Trying pkg-config
   Package libcgraph was not found in the pkg-config search path.
   Perhaps you should add the directory containing `libcgraph.pc'
   to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
   No package 'libcgraph' found

or

::

   pygraphviz/graphviz_wrap.c:2954:10: fatal error: 'graphviz/cgraph.h' file not found
   #include "graphviz/cgraph.h"
          ^
   1 error generated.
   error: command 'clang' failed with exit status 1

To fix, try running something like:

::

   $ brew install graphviz
   $ pip install --install-option="--include-path=/usr/local/include" --install-option="--library-path=/usr/local/lib" pygraphviz

Then re-run setup.
