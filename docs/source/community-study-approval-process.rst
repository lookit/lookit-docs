Study approval process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Remember, before your study can go live on CHS, there are three things you'll need to do:

1) :ref:`Sign and return the access agreement.<legal>` This covers your entire lab. You only have to do this once.

2) :ref:`Get IRB approval for your study at your own institution.<irb>`

3) Get peer feedback on the study, and then submit it to CHS for approval. This is the part we'll discuss here!


Why is there a study review process?
==============================================

Because CHS is a shared platform with a shared reputation, it
benefits all of us to uphold high standards for all CHS studies.
Families who have a good experience - the study is fun, it runs
smoothly, the instructions are easy to follow, they get a gift card
promptly or get quick friendly answers to their questions, their child
isn't upset by the stimuli - will come back. Positive media coverage
likewise benefits all of us.

To make sure all studies meet community standards, we use two forms
of review before studies are posted: another researcher
outside your lab providing feedback ("peer review"), and CHS staff reviewing
studies before approving them for posting ("admin review"). While this may feel 
like "extra steps" compared with
in-lab research, it's an opportunity to improve both the participant
experience and the science - saving you time later. So far, researchers 
who were frustrated by the extra steps have been convinced once they 
see how much their studies improve in the process.


What are the rules for external studies and 'live' sessions?
=============================================================

From the beginning of CHS through most of 2021, all studies listed on CHS 
were also run using the Lookit experiment runner. In contrast, 
the "External Study" type recruits participants via the CHS site but the 
experiment itself takes place elsewhere. This opens up the possibility for 
researchers to run "asynchronous" studies with any desired platform 
(e.g., Qualtrics) or "synchronous" studies (e.g., scheduled Zoom sessions).

In conjunction with the Children Helping Science/Lookit 
merger, we are expediting reviewing for external studies. 
Under this process, peer review is *optional* (but highly recommended) and 
admin review will be expedited; however, all external studies must still meet 
:ref:`basic requirements<basic_review_checklist>`.

You are also strongly encouraged to review the 
:ref:`study guidelines<self_review_checklist>` that we use for reviewing internal Lookit and jsPsych experiments,
and are always welcome to give and solicit peer review for any study type on Slack. This is 
probably the best way to learn about what features make studies successful on our
platform, and we recommend that all new researchers contribute peer reviews so that
you have seen at least one other remote study.  Graduate students, and undergraduate students
who are conducting mentored research, are considered peers and do not need 
to get special permission to contribute peer reviews.


If you don't have IRB approval or an access agreement yet
=========================================================

You can still go ahead with steps 1 and 2 below so you're ready to go as
soon as possible! The "Lab" your study is associated with on CHS will 
have to be approved to test before you'll be able to submit in Step 3, 
which means you'll need the access agreement set at that point.

Step 1: study preparation and self-review
================================================

First, get your study working smoothly, the way you want it to, and make 
any revisions from within-lab feedback. Please work through the :ref:`self-review checklist <self_review_checklist>` 
before requesting peer review!

Step 2: peer review
=====================

Next, post a preview link for your study on the CHS/Lookit Slack #researchers channel to  
gather some feedback from researchers *outside your group*. This is like getting a bunch 
of fresh eyes at a lab meeting made up of researchers who work online! Check out
the Slack channel to see many previous examples of how to post review requests, 
including links to your study and to the peer review form. Notice also that whenever 
someone posts a study review request, you will also see them volunteering to review
other recently posted studies - trading reviews in this way is how we keep the system going!

The goal of peer review is to have someone go through the study *exactly as a 
family browsing CHS would do*.  This means that you should always direct reviewers to
the CHS preview link, even if your study takes place externally. For instance, 
although much of our peer review documentation 
assumes that studies are asynchronous, for a synchronous study you should expect to demonstrate 
your entire procedure, from scheduling all the way to debriefing. Researchers who act as reviewers will
start from a CHS study link, sign up for a session and communicate with the 
experimenter exactly as a participant would, and attend & record a video chat 
session including all warmup, consent, and debrief that a participant would experience.


Peer reviewers can reference the :ref:`peer review checklist <peer_review_checklist>`
and will be looking for things like:

-  Typos
-  Overall flow of the study - are there any abrupt transitions? do they feel like they know what to expect?
-  Places where your instructions are confusing, overwhelming, condescending, etc.
-  Cases where your stimuli or prompts might be unintentionally confusing, upsetting, or unnecessarily non-inclusive (e.g., you’ve assumed that each child has a mother and father at home, that a child who’s experienced the birth of a sibling still has that sibling, etc.; you've prompted children to describe something bad that happened to them assuming they're going to think about stuff like their popsicle falling)
-  Whether your study description accurately reflects their experience
-  Experimental design issues that happen to occur to them (this isn't primarily a scientific review)

With this feedback you can revise and improve your study, often the instructions and parent-facing text in particular.

**You should also expect to return the favor and review other labs’ studies**, as part of participating in the platform.

Step 3: CHS submission and approval
======================================

When your study is ready and you’ve responded to the peer feedback,
you can :ref:`submit your study <study status>` for CHS approval so it can go live.
This is the point where you'll need to have your access agreement set up.

When you submit the study, you will be prompted to note any non-standard elements 
that require specific approval per the Terms of Use (e.g., integration of
additional information about participants from another source) as well as what
changes you made based on peer feedback.

At this point, CHS staff will review your study, focusing
primarily on the participant experience. This is also when any custom
code you're using will be reviewed for security or functionality
issues.

Initial internal review can generally be completed within 10 business days.
Revisions may be requested before the study can be approved to run.
To minimize the number of rounds of review needed, researchers are
strongly encouraged to polish their studies as much as possible
before submitting - please don't use us as a proofreading service!

.. admonition:: Outcomes of CHS review

   In general, although we technically reserve the right not to host work at our
   discretion, the outcomes of the CHS admin review process are "accept" and
   "revise and resubmit." We'll work with you to get your study ready to go.

   In rare cases, a study may be fine to run on CHS, but in the judgment of CHS
   admin staff, not a good idea to advertise publicly via CHS. (E.g., a study that is
   ethically designed, but stands an unusual chance of putting parents off coming back for
   other studies.) In this case a "partial
   approval" - to collect data, but not make discoverable - may be the final outcome. We
   consult with working group members before making such a decision to ensure it reflects
   community norms, and will devise a more formal process and expanded guidelines if this
   occurs more often.


Reapproval after changes
======================================

Most changes to studies require re-approval. If your study is active, paused, or approved,
and you make changes to it, it will be automatically rejected and you'll need to resubmit.
If your study has already been approved, you'll see a warning to this effect when you
click "save" letting you know which fields will require re-approval to change.

For minor changes ("we fixed a typo", "we clarified instructions", "we're stopping data
collection for some conditions", etc.) approval is quick - you do not go back into the
same queue as for initial submissions. We approve studies the same day 
(often within 1 business day, but no promises).

If you want, you can let us know you'd like the study restarted in addition to
reapproved. By default we just approve it and you can restart it when you're ready.
